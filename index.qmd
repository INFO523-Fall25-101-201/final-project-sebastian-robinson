## Abstract

Civilization V is a video game in which the player must explore and build their empire in a randomly generated map. There are many paths to victory including through conquest, construction, diplomacy and many more. With so many paths to pick from a user’s strategy can remain fluid, adapting rapidly based on their surroundings. This project aims to explore how we can determine these strategy changes and the reason for its change.
