Our Great Engineer birth in Istanbul provides strategic flexibility for rush military buildings/units. However, Indonesia still overwhelming with Light Tanks/Landships (60 strength) vs our Gatling Guns (32 strength). Combined Arms research progressing well - once complete we can produce Tanks to achieve military parity. Economic position strong (1190 Gold, 650 Science/turn). Cannot afford strategy change when Indonesia one capital away from Domination victory. Current defensive formations with EmpireDefenseCritical, WarMobilization, AtWar, NeedNavalUnitsCritical must continue holding until we can counter their armored superiority with Tanks and Machine Guns."
